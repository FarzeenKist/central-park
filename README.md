# Central Park
[Central Park](https://jamescodex.github.io/central-park/)

## Description
This is a decentralised NFT minting application that you can come to mint NFTs as trees, buy NFTs, sell NFTs, gift NFTs and so on. Every NFT minted represents a tree in the park. When a person plants a tree, an NFT is minted for them, and saved on the blockchain. My motivation for this project is to encourage people to plant more trees and get incentivisied in the process.
